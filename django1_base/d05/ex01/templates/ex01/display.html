		1. Client Sends a Request
			A user enters a URL (e.g., http://example.com/about) in their browser.
			The browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server.
		2. URL Routing
			The server receives the request and uses a URL router (urls.py) to match the URL path to a view function.
		3. View Function Called
			The matched view function is executed. Its job is to handle the logic and return a response.
			Inside the view, a template rendering function (render()) is called.
			The framework loads the HTML template (about.html) from the template directory.
			Since it’s a static page, no dynamic context or data is injected — just pure HTML.
		5. HTTP Response Created
			The rendered HTML is wrapped in an HTTP response object.
			The response is returned to the client.
		6. Browser Displays the Page
			The client’s browser receives the response.
			It parses and displays the static HTML content to the user.
